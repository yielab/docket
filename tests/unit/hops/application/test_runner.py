"""POST /tasks/<project> — enqueue a task over HTTP.

See specs/data/serve-read-api.spec.md ("POST /tasks/<project>") for the
endpoint contract this suite pins. Test classes: TestAuth (Bearer-gated
like ``/dispatch/`` and ``/runs``), TestBadRequests (malformed/invalid
bodies are 400 before ``enqueue_task_once`` runs), TestMissingPod (no pod is
404, not 500), TestPolicyGates (``pre_input`` gate behaves as the CLI
path does, since this route calls the same ``enqueue_task_once``),
TestSuccess (happy path), and TestExecuteUnitDirectly (``_execute_unit``
and two extracted phases, called directly with a hand-built
``_UnitContext``/``PlannedUnit``).
