"""Real git evidence helpers (`git_head_sha`, `git_merge_base`, `git_diff_stat`).

Each degrades to `None` rather than raising -- the same convention `git_current_branch`/
`git_changed_files` already use -- on a missing binary, a non-repository directory, or an
unresolvable ref. `subprocess.run` is monkeypatched throughout, mirroring
`tests/integration/test_system_adapter.py`'s pattern; no real git process ever runs here.
