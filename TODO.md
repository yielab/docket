# TODO — active task board

> **This is docket's single standing TODO file.** It holds the executable cards for whatever phase is
> currently active in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). Do **not** create per-phase task files — when a phase
> finishes, clear its cards (the phase record stays in ROADMAP) and append the next phase's cards here.
>
> **History lives elsewhere.** Every closed wave and phase section that used to sit in this file is
> archived verbatim in [docs/cycles-ended/](docs/cycles-ended/README.md) (`todo-waves.md`, with a
> SHA-256 manifest). This file holds only the usage rules, the active section and planned sections.
> Do not mine the archive for work.

> **Waves 89–90 closed 2026-10-05** (no phase; ROADMAP, ADR 0020 "Closed by Waves 89–90"): every

> ### Phase 38 closed 2026-10-05
>
> **Phase 38 closed 2026-10-05** (ROADMAP D-55,
> [ADR 0020](docs/adr/0020-the-execution-envelope.md)): eleven cards over Waves 85–88 (nine
> planned, two found while integrating: P38-10 from the live run, P38-11 from a measurement); the
> section is archived verbatim in [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md).
> It shipped isolation on by default (bwrap first, a jail that can commit, hooks and config
> read-only), an opt-in `network none`, stdio MCP servers in the jail, file tools confined against
> symlinks and `..` selectors, `pre_input` on `fetch` results, docket's credentials stripped from
> task processes, one sweep worker per pod, posture refusals that are not retried, and a bounded
> redaction pattern. Not pushed. No phase is planned: the next step is triage.
>
> **Phase 37 closed 2026-10-04** (ROADMAP D-54,
> [ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-verification-ready-execution.md)): nine cards over Waves 82–84; the
> section is archived verbatim in [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md).
> It shipped one git worktree per task (created at claim, recorded on the task, the evidence base),
> `pre_input` on MCP tool results, task coordinates for command steps, a `no_progress` stop,
> recipe-declared pod-scoped MCP servers started in the turn's root, and the `anti-tautology`,
> `mutation`, `spec-writer`, `cross-family-review` and `code-intel` recipes. Not pushed.
>
> **Phase 36 closed 2026-10-04** (ROADMAP D-53,
> [ADR 0018](docs/adr/0018-consultation-packs-and-evidence-v1.md)): eleven cards over Waves 76-81
> (ten P36 cards plus the Phase 35 follow-up P35-12); the section is archived verbatim in
> [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md). It shipped operator-v1.1
> (`kind`, `options`, `recommendation`, `optionId`, `reason`/`actor` on grant and deny), approval
> packs with a rationale and three options, the `consult` tool (single turn and pod park), the
> corrections ledger, evidence-v1 behind the CLI, HTTP and the harness result, and escalation
> metrics. Not pushed. Phases 37-38 are planned below and are **not claimable** until their phase
> opens.
>
> **Phase 35 closed 2026-10-04** (ROADMAP D-51,
> [ADR 0017](docs/adr/0017-docket-in-a-harness-agnostic-factory.md)): ten cards over Waves 71–75
> plus P35-11; the section is archived verbatim in
> [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md). It shipped the opt-in harness
> contract v1.1 (process events, stdin answers, written paths, `--token-file`, caller limits,
> `--recipe` in place, typed `approvals`) and evidence kept on every pod hop.
>
> **Phase 34 closed 2026-09-29** (ROADMAP D-50,
> [ADR 0016](docs/adr/0016-operator-loop-and-interop-standards.md)): seventeen cards over Waves
> 64–70, one worker per card (Sonnet, or Haiku where the card said so) in isolated worktrees
> under one integrator; the section is archived verbatim in
> [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md) and packets stay in
> [.agents/handoffs/wave-64-worker-packets.md](.agents/handoffs/wave-64-worker-packets.md).
> What shipped: an unattended pod **parks** instead of blocking (`approvalMode: park`, a
> single-use pre-grant on the re-entered hop); the Lead's typed `TaskBrief` intake asks before it
> builds, with a deterministic resource pre-check and the `intake` recipe; one derived inbox
> (`docket inbox`, `GET /inbox`, the MCP `inbox` tool, Telegram `/status`); notifications as
> CloudEvents over every v1 `kind: channel` dialect (console, webhook, command, ntfy, desktop,
> email, Telegram); questions in the MCP elicitation shape and every task state mapped onto A2A
> 1.0.0; answer surfaces on CLI, `docket chat`, HTTP, MCP and Telegram's new `/answer` verb;
> interruption forecasting (`docket pod <p> explain interruptions`) and pre-grants from intake.
> The integrator's close (P34-17) added three real seam tests (HTTP-driven park→pregrant→
> redispatch, channel content-level enforcement at actual delivery, and the operator's answer
> text reaching the Lead's own re-entry message) and found two real defects by running the
> product rather than reading it: the operator-loop scenario's own `eventsDelivered` counter read
> a health-file key that never existed (always `0`); `--live-model` registered its provider after
> `docket init`, so that path had never actually completed `init`. A third, unrelated regression
> the starter's own persisted-shape check caught: `HandoffArtifact` gained a `brief` field with no
> update to the starter's asserted shape or its own spec. Both deferred triggers this phase left
> behind were evaluated at the close and did not fire (recorded in the ADR, not acted on): fewer
> than 10 real parked approvals exist to measure the pre-grant re-issue rate against, and the
> scripted-backend scenario shows `park` removing the blocking wait it targets — a live model's
> own serial per-hop generation latency is a separate, real cost worth a maintainer's attention,
> not this trigger's condition. `docket inbox`/`channels`/`notify`/`pregrant`/`explain
> interruptions` still lack coverage in `cli-interface.spec.md`, flagged there for a follow-up
> card rather than backfilled under this pass's time budget. Nothing else is parked.
>
> **Phase 33 closed 2026-09-28** (ROADMAP D-49, [ADR 0015](docs/adr/0015-export-privacy-levels.md)):
> six cards over Waves 60–63, one Sonnet worker, then two, then two, then the integrator; the
> section is archived verbatim in [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md)
> and packets stay in [.agents/handoffs/wave-60-worker-packets.md](.agents/handoffs/wave-60-worker-packets.md).
> What shipped: an exporter document declares what it shares beyond structure (`privacy:
> minimal|actions|conversation|full` or `share:`; `minimal` for every built-in; `payload`
> retired and loaded as `minimal`); an allowlist projection maps each attribute to one class and
> filters conversations per message part; `llm_call` and `tool_result` capture content only
> while an exporter grants it; `docket exporters privacy` widens only after naming what leaves
> and to which host (TTY confirmation or `--yes`, audited); `docket exporters preview` shows the
> exact spans offline; `SHARES`, "Leaves this host", `docket.privacy` on every root span.
> Verified live at three levels with canaries against a local collector and Langfuse, none at
> `minimal`. Lessons: the seam test between two green cards found a real gap twice (the
> per-exporter bound skipped `response`/`arguments`; the live loop never wrote tool output) —
> the second only showed on a real run, because every earlier test fed synthetic records that
> already had the field. Follow-up recorded, not scheduled: the idle flush can emit a session's
> root span twice (`observability-export.spec.md` §"Privacy levels").
>
> **Phase 32 closed 2026-09-28** (ROADMAP D-48, [ADR 0014](docs/adr/0014-observability-export.md)):

> [.agents/handoffs/wave-56-worker-packets.md](.agents/handoffs/wave-56-worker-packets.md).
> What shipped: every backend chat-completions exchange is a durable `llm_call` trace event;
> `core/telemetry.py` deterministically projects the trace into a neutral `Span`/`SpanEvent`
> model with `metadata`/`full` payload reduction; a destination is a `kind: exporter` YAML
> document (five ready-made, disabled-by-default: `otel-collector`, `jaeger`, `langfuse`,
> `honeycomb`, `phoenix`) speaking one hand-rolled `otlp-http` wire dialect, no SDK dependency
> (D-24 stands); a bounded queue/background-sender `Pipeline` is wired into every turn;
> `docket exporters list|show|enable|disable|test|add|remove|export` turns a destination on by
> authenticating; a pod names its destinations in `pod.yaml`'s `exporters:`, reported, never
> itself activating. Verified live 2026-09-28 against a real dispatch and a real
> `otel/opentelemetry-collector`; the live Langfuse round-trip was confirmed the
> same day once the operator stored `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`/`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`. Two
> recurring integration lessons: independent cards that version-bump the same still-Draft spec
> from the same base conflict on merge, predictably (happened three times, reconciled by hand
> each time); a card's own literal acceptance text can be stale relative to already-shipped code
> from an earlier card in the same phase (P32-8, P32-9) — implement against the verified live
> behavior and record the discrepancy, per AGENTS.md's rule, rather than choosing the convenient
> reading.

## How to use this board (read before claiming a task)

1. **Claim:** set Status → `IN-PROGRESS (@you)`. One agent per task.
2. **Read first (bounded):** use `$docket-roadmap` to load the active card, its named ROADMAP
   decision/section, the owning spec, and the card's own "Read" list. Do not ingest all of
   `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, or local `CLAUDE.md` as startup context.
3. **Layer rule (non-negotiable):** `cli/ → core/ → edges/`, inward only. docket-owned JSON goes
   **only** through `edges/store.py` (JSONL append logs are the one D-12 exemption), external
   protocols terminate in `edges/adapters/`, and there is no compatibility layer for the retired
   daemon. Every shell-out goes through `edges/adapters/`. `core/`/`edges/` never import `ui.py` or
   print (D-3 from Phase 12).
4. **No-behavior-change rule, except where a card says otherwise:** the golden suite
   (`bash tests/golden/run.sh verify-all`) must stay byte-identical unless a card explicitly adds new
   CLI surface — those cards say so and require regenerated goldens with the diff explained.
   **Regenerating a golden to paper over an unintended behaviour change is never acceptable**; W-6 in
   particular must prove the four legacy roles still emit byte-identical workspaces.
5. **Definition of done (per task):** acceptance criteria pass · a pytest covers it (add/refresh a
   golden case if output changes) · `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run
   mypy src && uv run pytest` green · `bash tests/golden/run.sh verify-all` green ·
   `bash scripts/validate-specs.sh` green · `uv run python scripts/gen_cli_docs.py --check` green
   (regenerate `docs/commands.md` whenever a Typer docstring or help text changes) · `uv run pytest
   tests/agent` green when prose or an artifact moved · the integrator re-measures
   `scripts/metrics.py --check` per batch (card branches that add tests fail it by design) · the
   card's own spec updated with a version bump + changelog entry (integrator-applied in a
   multi-agent wave), **Status line matching what actually shipped** · committed `Type: description`
   (no Claude/Co-Authored-By trailer) · public-repo privacy scrubbed (grep the diff for real names /
   `/home/<user>` paths before committing).
6. **Central files:** `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md` and `README.md`'s metric counts are maintained by the
   integrator, **not** by card branches. Phase 14 lost time to roll-up checkboxes and README test
   counts conflicting on nearly every merge; cards now report what they shipped instead of editing
   the board.

**Status legend:** `TODO` · `IN-PROGRESS (@who)` · `BLOCKED (needs X)` · `DONE`
**Size:** S ≈ ½ day · M ≈ 1–2 days · L ≈ 3–5 days (split before claiming if L)
**Branch model (D-52, amending D-31):** **`develop`** is the integration branch. Every card
branch or isolated worktree bases on `develop` and is integrated into `develop` without
rewriting history. **`main`** stays the canonical public/default and release lineage: it moves
only by a fast-forward (or a merge) from `develop`, when the maintainer cuts a release or
decides `main` has fallen too far behind. Tags and release jobs still originate from `main`.
`platform` may remain as a synchronized historical ref, but it is not a release source.

## ◇ NO ACTIVE WAVE — Waves 89–90 closed 2026-10-05 (archived above in docs/cycles-ended/)

No phase is planned and nothing is carried. The next step is bounded triage or measurement, not a
card mined from history. Deferred to named triggers: `kind: autonomy` (a verifier that emits one)
and per-task credential minting (an issuer a pod needs).
