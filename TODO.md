> ## ▶ ACTIVE BOARD — WAVE 62 (2026-11-03): Phase 62
>
> **Active: Phase 62 (D-84)**, accepted 2026-11-03, below, in two waves; no card is claimed yet. Phases 60 (D-82) and 61 (D-83) closed 2026-11-03: a transient failure costs a request, a pod says what it can reach, and `fetch` keeps the perimeter. Their sections are archived and what they leave open is in the follow-ups below. Phase 59 (D-81, [ADR 0038](docs/adr/0038-a-step-budget-is-a-checkpoint-not-a-cliff.md)) closed 2026-11-03
> (decision 5 amended before the push): a step's budget is a checkpoint, not a cliff, and docket keeps no dollars. Its
> section is archived and what it leaves open is under "Phase 59" in the follow-ups below. Phase 58 (D-80) closed 2026-11-02: what a plan of record needs to follow a team it does
> not run. Its section is archived and what it leaves open is under "Phase 58" in the follow-ups below.
> **Phase 57** (D-79, [ADR 0037](docs/adr/0037-what-docket-gives-a-manager-in-the-plan-of-record.md)) closed 2026-11-01. Before it, Phase 56 (D-77, [ADR 0036](docs/adr/0036-a-pod-works-outward.md) decisions 13-16) closed
> 2026-10-30: an external service is declared, not programmed; a pod keeps records; one judge; one home layout; the
> four team shapes. Its section is archived and what it leaves open is under "Phase 56" in the follow-ups below.
> Decisions 15-16 of the ADR were accepted by the maintainer the same day. Phase 55
> closed 2026-10-30; Phases 52 to 54 closed 2026-10-29. The integration branch is `develop`. A new phase starts from
> a measured trigger or a maintainer request.

## How to use this board (read before claiming a card)

1. **One card is one worker run.** Its steps are ordered; each step ends green and committed. A run
   that does not finish parks at its last green commit and the card's Status names what is left; the
   next run continues the same card. A card is never split into sub-cards to make it fit.
2. **Claim.** Set Status to `IN-PROGRESS (@who)`; one owner per card. The worker gets a worktree made
   by hand from the integration branch's current head (`git worktree add -b <branch>
   .claude/worktrees/<card> <sha>`), and its own `DOCKET_HOME` and temp directory in the scratchpad.
3. **Read bounded.** `python3 .agents/skills/docket-roadmap/scripts/card_packet.py <CARD-ID>`, then
   the card's own read list. Never all of `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, `CLAUDE.md` or a spec directory.
   A task worktree has no `internal-docs/` (gitignored); a card needs only itself and tracked files.
4. **The layer rule** is ADR 0030's table, enforced by `tests/architecture/`: the contexts are layered
   `platform < governance < agent < models < observability < pipeline < teams < sandbox < operator <
   tasks < hops` and a context imports only those below it; `kernel` imports nothing outside itself;
   a `domain/` is pure; only `interfaces/` talks to the user; `bootstrap.py` is the only module that
   names a concrete adapter. Two invariants never move: every tool call passes `dispatch_tool`
   (`agent/tools/registry.py`), and docket-owned JSON is written only by `platform/store.py`.
5. **The testing budget, the same for every card.**
   1. Per commit: `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run mypy src && uv run
      pytest --co -q` (about 10 s). No test runs.
   2. While iterating: only the tests of what the step changed, by path, each under `timeout 120`.
   3. The card's gate, as the card names it, in a few minutes.
   4. A pure move or rename adds no test: `pytest --co` and `tests/architecture` are its check. A
      behaviour change adds a failing test first, placed by lane (`specs/test-framework.md`).
   5. After each merge the integrator runs the default suite once, in parallel (`uv run pytest -n auto
      --dist loadfile -q --tb=line -p no:cacheprovider > <file>`, about 85 s), reads only the `FAILED`
      lines, fixes by cause and re-runs `--lf`. Never a second full run for the same merge. What
      each check costs, measured, is in `.agents/skills/docket-spec-work/references/validation.md`.
   6. Goldens, the agent lane, `scripts/maint/pytest-without-sandbox.sh`, the escape matrix,
      `validate-specs.sh`, the generated-docs checks and the real run: once, at
      the phase close. The agent lane takes about 5 min.
   7. **Stop rule:** a check that fails again after one fix stops the step. Park with the failing line
      and the hypothesis. No third attempt, no "until green", no background process or polling, no
      `git stash` (a WIP commit sets work aside).
   8. **A script is a means, not a deliverable.** A one-shot script (planner, path rewriter,
      converter) exists to save effort on the card's goal. Write it once, run it, review its output,
      and finish by hand whatever it did not cover. If it is wrong after one fix, stop improving it
      and do the remainder by bounded edits. Polishing, generalizing or testing a throwaway script is
      out of scope; it is never committed unless the card says so.
6. **Baselines only shrink.** A baseline file is rewritten (`--write`) only after the violations are
   gone, and its diff is deletions only. A new guard is trusted only after it was seen failing on a
   planted case.
7. **No behaviour change** unless the card says so: the HTTP API 6 tests, the CLI goldens and the
   `docket_runtime` facade stay byte for byte. **No re-export or shim:** a replaced name is
   deleted in the same change, with no alias or compatibility reader.
8. **Central files are integrator-owned:** `TODO.md`, `ROADMAP.md`, `README.md` metric counts and
   `CHANGELOG.md`. A worker reports what shipped; it does not edit them.
9. **Commits:** `Type: description`, ASCII only, a detailed body, no AI or assistant attribution.
   Scrub `/home/<user>` paths and real names from every diff.

**Status:** `TODO` · `IN-PROGRESS (@who)` · `BLOCKED (needs X)` · `PARKED (left: X)` · `DONE`.
**Size:** S ≈ one short run · M ≈ one run · L ≈ one long run that may park once · XL ≈ two cards'
scope in one pass over the same files, parks at least once.
**Branch model (D-52):** card branches base on and merge into the integration branch (`develop`).
`main` moves only
by a fast-forward from `develop` when the maintainer cuts a release. Tags and release jobs originate
from `main`.

## ▶ PHASE 62 ACTIVE — WAVE 62 · a new user can research without knowing what to install (D-84) · accepted 2026-11-03

> From the maintainer (2026-11-03): installing docket and running `docket init --recipe web-research`
> must be enough, and what is still missing must be told, not found as a refusal. P61-8 reads a PDF
> through `pdftotext`, which a new user must install, and which needs a manual read grant when it lies

>
> **Waves (by file):** 1: P62-1 · 2: P62-2 (it reports P62-1's readiness). P62-1 owns
> `hops/application/pdf_text.py`, `sandbox/pdf_extract.py`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` and the
> Homebrew formula; P62-2 owns `teams/apply/recipes.py` and the `web-research` recipe.

### P62-1 — The PDF reader runs docket's own Python in the jail, with no external binary

**Status:** DONE 2026-11-03 (live: with no read grant, a web-research fetch of the arXiv paper 1706.03762 returned 30,037 chars of text from docket's own interpreter in the jail; the Seatbelt and Docker paths are untested) · **Size:** M · **Model:** Sonnet · **Kind:** behaviour + spec · **After:** P61-8 (done)

- **Trigger:**
  - The maintainer's request (2026-11-03): installing docket and running `docket init` must be enough to
    read a PDF.
  - P61-8 needs poppler, and on Linuxbrew (or any prefix outside Landlock's `DEFAULT_RO`) it also needs
    a manual `docket setup sandbox read add`.
  - The jail already reads `sys.prefix` and `sys.base_prefix` (`sandbox/landlock.py` ~97-98,
    `sandbox/seatbelt.py` ~46), so docket's own interpreter runs in it with no grant.
- **Goal:**
  - `pypdf` (pure Python, BSD, no required dependencies) becomes a **base** dependency, not an extra:
    `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock` and a `resource "pypdf"` block in `Formula/docket-cli.rb` (16 already).
  - A new `src/docket/sandbox/pdf_extract.py` imports only the standard library and `pypdf`. It sets its
    own `RLIMIT_AS` (for example 1 GiB) and `RLIMIT_CPU` before it parses, reads `in.pdf` and writes the
    text of each page to stdout. A failure is exit 1 with one stderr line. The `docket.sandbox` package
    is already imported in the jail (`-m docket.sandbox.jail`): check that its `__init__` stays light.
  - In `hops/application/pdf_text.py`, for Landlock and Seatbelt, `EXTRACTOR` and `_ARGS` (~28-29)
    become `(sys.executable, "-I", "-m", "docket.sandbox.pdf_extract", "in.pdf")`. The `which()` lookup
    and the poppler refusal go.
  - Everything else stays as P61-8 has it: one fresh root, network off, no credential, the deadline,
    the output cap and the fail-closed refusals.
  - **Docker backend:** the image has no docket venv. Keep the image's `pdftotext` there, as today, or
    refuse naming a fix; the worker chooses and documents that it is the one place an extractor is
    external.
- **Non-goals:** OCR; layout and tables; keeping `pdftotext` as an option on Landlock or Seatbelt (one
  path, no fallback).
- **Change:** `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `Formula/docket-cli.rb`; `sandbox/pdf_extract.py` (new);
  `hops/application/pdf_text.py`; `tests/unit/hops/application/test_pdf_text.py`;
  `tests/integration/hops/test_pdf_text__jail.py`; a bomb fixture and the script under `scripts/maint/`
  that generates it. Specs: `security-gates.spec.md` `fetch` (the PDF rule now says docket's interpreter
  and `pypdf`), `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` wherever it names poppler. The architecture tests must accept
  `sandbox/pdf_extract.py` importing a third-party package.
- **Acceptance (RED first):**
  - Integration: with no `pdftotext` anywhere on `PATH` (a `PATH` holding only the shell's dirs) and no
    read grant recorded, `tests/fixtures/documents/hola.pdf` gives "Hola docket". Oracle: on P61-8 this
    is refused with "install poppler".
  - Integration: a PDF that inflates past `RLIMIT_AS` (a compressed-stream bomb, generated by the
    committed script) is refused and no process is left.
  - Integration: the escape probes (read the token, open a socket, sleep) are rerun against the
    extractor's command through a fake module seam, or kept as the fake-on-`PATH` test for Docker only;
    either way each probe is seen to fail inside the jail.
  - Unit: no `which()` call is made for Landlock or Seatbelt.
- **Live (integrator):** with the Linuxbrew `pdftotext` hidden from `PATH` and still no read grant, a
  `web-research` `fetch` of an arXiv PDF returns text. This also clears P61-8's open live step.
- **Gate:** the two test files; `tests/architecture`; `tests/e2e -n auto`; the escape matrix; `uv build`
  (the dependency changed).

### P62-2 — A recipe says what its work still needs when it is applied

**Status:** TODO · **Size:** M · **Model:** Sonnet · **Kind:** behaviour + spec · **After:** P62-1
(it reports P62-1's readiness)

- **Trigger:** the same request. `src/docket/templates/recipes/web-research/README.md` lists its
  prerequisites in prose, and still says exact hosts in `FETCH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` and an MCP search
  server, both stale after P61-2 and ADR 0036 decision 17. Nothing checks them, so a new user finds
  each gap as a refusal.
- **Goal:**
  - `docket init --recipe web-research` and `docket pod update web-research` end with a short readiness
    block computed from facts the pod report already serves (P61-1, P61-2):
    - the pod's `fetchDomains` (empty: "the researchers cannot read the web: `docket pod set
      fetchDomains ...`");
    - whether a search host is in the set (for example `html.duckduckgo.com`) or a search service is
      declared;
    - whether isolation is on (no: "PDFs are not read: `docket setup sandbox on`").
  - Each line that is not ready names one command. The README is rewritten to `pod set fetchDomains` and
    a search site as a host, in the same commit. The block is informational: the apply never fails on it.
  - Where the prerequisites are declared is the worker's decision; the suggestion is a `needs:` list in
    the recipe's `pod.yaml`, read by `teams/apply/recipes.py`, so other recipes can use it, kept to
    these three facts.
- **Non-goals:** writing any setting for the user; a wizard; checking that a search site answers.
- **Acceptance (RED first):** for a fresh home with isolation off and no `fetchDomains`, the apply
  output lists three not-ready lines, each with its command, and writes nothing more than today
  (oracle: today it prints none). After `pod set fetchDomains 'html.duckduckgo.com,*.wikipedia.org'`
  with isolation on, it reports all ready.
- **Gate:** the recipes apply test (`tests/integration/teams/test_recipes.py`); `tests/architecture`;
  `gen_cli_docs --check` if the output is documented.

## ◇ FOLLOW-UPS WITH TRIGGERS (not cards; triage when a trigger fires)

> Re-checked against the code on 2026-10-24; paths are current. Removed as no longer true: notification
> dedup is persisted (`operator/notify.py`), the `kind:`-less canonical-document advisory is gone, and
> `_create_workspace` no longer exists. Decisions that belong to the maintainer are in ROADMAP §7.1.

**Phases 60-61 (planned 2026-11-03).** Left out of the cards on purpose:
- *PDF reading in `setup check`.* After P61-8, `docket setup check` could report whether a PDF is
  readable: whether `pdftotext` is found, whether the jail can execute it, and whether isolation is
  on. Trigger: an operator's first PDF refusal for a missing grant.
- *The `web-research` recipe after P61-2.* Its README (`templates/recipes/web-research/README.md`)
  still tells the operator to list exact hosts in `FETCH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS` and to declare search as an
  MCP server. Once P61-2 and P61-6 are merged, the README teaches `pod set fetchDomains` and a search
  site as a host (ADR 0036 decision 17). Trigger: P61-6 merged.
- *Dead retry plumbing after P60-1.* `UnitContext.do_sleep`/`on_retry` (`tasks/application/record.py`
  ~261-263), `executor.dispatch_task`'s `on_retry`/`sleep` (~475-580) and `sweep._touch` (~161) have no
  reader. Delete with P61-3, which owns `record.py` next.
- *`NOT_ENFORCED` wording.* "isolation off" is also what a machine with isolation on and no backend prints
  (`teams/network_posture.py`); changing it moves a golden and security-gates requirement 14. `pod_summary`
  probes the backend per row. Trigger: an operator misreads the line, or a pod list slower than 50 ms.
- *Is `capability_missing` pinned?* Whether P61-3's kind joins `_PINNED_FAILURE_KINDS` (`record.py`).
- *`fetch` text extraction and its byte cap.* The live Chile page was cut at the infobox by the 200,000-byte cap
  (`platform/fetch.py`), before the first sentence: the cap counts HTML, not text. Trigger: a research task that
  reports a page it could not read. P61-6 changes the body rules; decide there or after it.
- *A pod.yaml `fetchDomains` is not a run item.* `teams/apply/review.py` `_NOT_ADDED_SETTINGS`: should adding
  hosts need `accept`? Also `_export_manifest` exports a pod's `*` as `fetchDomains: '*'`, which `pod update`
  refuses. Trigger: the first repo that ships `fetchDomains`. Tack: `pod-reach.json` gained `fetchDomains`.
- *The fetch refusal for a host off the pod's list does not name the pod command.* `platform/fetch.py` ~279 says
  "add it to FETCH_ALLOWED_DOMAINS, or to the pod's fetchDomains"; P61-3's card wanted the exact `docket pod set`
  command. `platform` does not know the pod. Trigger: a hop that stops on this refusal and a person asks how.
- *`capability_missing` for a tool is "a name the role could hold".* P61-3 chose that over "a tool another member
  holds" so a deliberate `deniedTools` is not a gap. A Reviewer calling a record write it may not use now fails
  the task `capability_missing` (`tests/e2e/test_workdir_pod.py` follows).
- *Sibling consult parts and expiry.* P61-4: if one part expires (`onExpiry: block`) the others become unanswerable
  (`tasks/application/escalation_sweep.py`); `operator/inbox.py` `_pending_id` shows only the newest pending part
  while `/escalations` lists all (live: `docket inbox` printed one question for a two-part consult); if the parked
  token's question is lost, parts 1..n-1 stay orphaned on a failed task. Trigger: a two-part consult that expires,
  or a person who cannot find the first question in the inbox.
- *A refused `fetch` URL still sits in the trace.* P61-7 refuses the call and keeps the key out of the result and the
  audit row, but the trace's `tool_call` event records the model's arguments as written (seen in a live trace), and
  `governance/gate.py` `render_tool_call` renders `fetch url=...` for `pre_tool_call` policies. Trigger: the first
  export at a privacy level that sends tool arguments (`full`) of a run that had a refusal; then redact call
  arguments with the same `secrets.redact` before the trace writes them. Also unmatched: a double-encoded key, a
  stored secret of 8 characters or fewer, and the keyring backend (the spec lists them under `unlisted-secret-shape`).
- *`run_jailed` lives in `platform/fetch.py`.* P61-8 put the jailed Popen, process-group kill and bounded read there
  because `tests/guards/test_no_subprocess_in_core.py` forbids `subprocess` in `hops/`. Move it to its own
  `platform` module. Also stale: the `ToolContext.read_only` comment ("only a jailed bash reads them",
  `agent/tools/registry.py` ~94), and a `setup check` line for `pdftotext`. The `header n chars` of a PDF result counts
  the returned text, not the full extraction.
- *PDF reading, after P62-1.* `setup check` still has no line for the PDF reader (TODO's older mentions of a
  `pdftotext` check are stale: the extractor is docket's own `pypdf`); an encrypted PDF is refused (only the empty
  password is tried and AES needs `cryptography`); `pypdf` decodes about 30 MB/s, so a real stream bomb ends by the
  1 GiB memory limit or the deadline after ~30 s of CPU. The jail runs a copy of `pdf_extract.py` beside `in.pdf`
  because `-m docket...` fails when docket is editable. Trigger: a PDF a user needs that these refuse.
- *The PDF reader on Seatbelt and Docker was never run.* `sandbox/pdf_extract.py` treats `RLIMIT_AS` as best effort
  (macOS does not enforce it) and `RLIMIT_CPU` as mandatory, proven only with a fake `resource` module. Trigger:
  before the next release tag (or earlier, a user on a Mac): run `hola.pdf` and the bomb fixture through
  `tests/integration/hops/test_pdf_text__jail.py` on a Seatbelt host with the macOS probe-branch technique, and
  once through the Docker backend.
- *Streaming with an idle timeout.* A stall is only seen after `AGENT_LOOP_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_S`
  because a non-streamed reply sends nothing until it ends. Trigger: after P60-1, more than one
  `request_retry` per 50 requests over a week of the live home, or a turn that ends `timeout` after
  its retries.
- *A cache breakpoint at the condensed boundary.* Replayed: with P60-2's sizes, a miss would re-send
  69 % of what it re-sends without one. Trigger: after P60-2, `messages_changed` on more than 20 % of
  a real task's requests.
- *A missing workdir folder.* Not seen: `web-research`'s exists, and Tack's `workdir: null` was the
  absent field (P61-1). Trigger: a dispatch whose recorded `workDir` is gone; then the docket-owned
  default is recreated, and a declared location becomes a profile violation and a `POST /tasks` 422.
- *A network failure inside `bash`.* No deterministic signal; P61-5 states the posture. Trigger: a
  recorded hop that tried the network after its message said `none`.
- *Approvals for shell idioms.* 7 of the live home's 9 failed hops (2026-10-24..11-03, mostly before
  Phase 59) parked on `$(`, `${` or a redirect to `/tmp`. Trigger: a week after Phase 59 in which
  approvals park more than one Implementer hop in five.

**Toolchain read grants (dropped from Phase 48).** A sibling project's gates failed with exit 126 under the
jail until each toolchain under `$HOME` (`~/.nvm`, `~/.pyenv`, `~/.cargo`) was granted by hand with
`docket setup sandbox read add`. Trigger: a second pod whose first jailed gate fails that way. Next:
`docket setup` proposes the grants for the toolchains it finds.

**Phase 55 Wave 1 (merged 2026-10-30).** Loose ends, none a card yet; the first two belong to the later cards
that already own the files.
- *Specs that lag.* `trace-store.spec.md` items 30-32 say every `process_*` payload carries `pgid`; MCP events carry
  none. `audit.spec.md` (~line 77) omits `pod.network_widen` / `pod.network_narrow`. P55-12 or the next card that
  edits either spec.
- *Required variables supplied by tasks.* `dispatch_pod`'s up-front check refuses a `required` pipeline variable that
  only tasks supply. P55-9 (routines) meets it first.
- *Smaller.* `docket task cancel` does not kill a `hop` MCP session directly (it closes at hop end); a top-level
  `networkGrant` in `pod.yaml` is an unknown-key error, not a skip (only under `settings`).
- *Flakes under load, seen once each and passing alone:* `test_run.py::TestForegroundApprovalPrompt` (two tests),
  `test_consult_wait.py::TestAnsweredInPlace::test_an_option_answer_goes_back_to_the_model_in_the_same_turn`,
  `test_end_to_end.py` approval-mode tests. A second failure of the same test is its trigger.
- *Phase 55 Wave 2, P55-3.* The `outward` recipe's policy `ask` names one tool, `mcp__outbox__send`
  (`when.tool` matches an exact name), so a send tool of another name is not asked about: a kind predicate or a default
  `ask` for every `send` tool belongs with P55-4. `--kind` stays an operator assertion, not verified against the server.
  A pipeline step that runs a role from the pod's existing registry (not in the applied directory) is not checked by
  the read/act rule.
- *Phase 55 Wave 2, P55-6.* `docket task show` "Waiting on you", the foreground `run` progress view and Telegram
  `/status` do not special-case a `wait`. `serve-read-api.spec.md` (the `kind` label list) and `a2a-binding.spec.md`
  (`escalationKind`) still list five kinds. `docket_escalations_total` counts a probe-resolved wait as `by=person`. A
  `stale_claim` between wake and claim drops the wait, so the next claim parks the step again. A monitor-only `docket
  start` never runs a probe (only a dispatching sweep does). Tack's maintainer is told: `wait` is an additive
  `EscalationKind`, `machine` an additive `EscalationPolicy`, the task is `waiting_input` with a2a state `WORKING`, a
  timed-out wait with no route is `blocked` / `wait_expired`, and `POST /escalations/<id>` `{optionId: "resume"}` ends
  it early. The e2e lane took 344 s once on this host against about 42 s measured before; its slowest tests are 13 s,
  so it was host load, not a test; re-measure if it repeats.
- *Phase 55 Wave 3.*
  - P55-2: the refusal golden is not added. `tests/golden/run.sh` derives the command from the case id and
    `setup model set` validates the model id (it contains `/`) before the role; a CLI unit test in
    `tests/unit/interfaces/cli/commands/test_setup_model.py` plus checking the role first would fix both. The refusal
    hint and `setup model list` name only the ten built-in roles; `known_role_names()` reads every overlay per call.
  - P55-4: `task show --json` carries no `call` (deliberate). The `Authorization` redaction pattern needs a token of
    about 20 characters after "Bearer". `outward` and `call` are additive to `operator-v2`; tell Tack's maintainer.
  - P55-9: `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` and `kernel/layout.py` do not list `docket-routines.json`;
    `pod-blueprints.spec.md` omits `routines/` from the `pod update` list; the recipe summary line does not name
    routines; cron day-of-month and day-of-week are ANDed, as in the existing parser; `tzdata` is not a declared
    dependency; no `--tz`-aware `HH:MM` form. A routine fires only under `docket start --dispatch`.
    A routine skip is traced as `step_skipped` because `EVENT_TYPES` is closed.
- *Phase 55 Wave 4.*
  - P55-10, a gap in the flow: nothing user-facing stores a secret under an arbitrary name such as `crm` (provider add
    and notify write only their own names; `setup_notify.store_secret` is the one writer), so a `secret:crm` reference
    needs `secrets.json` or the keyring edited by hand. Recommended: a `docket setup secret set <name>` command that
    reads the value from stdin or a prompt and never echoes it; needs the maintainer's go as a card. Sessions and the
    model's own reply carry raw tool output (the model sees it); not checked. `setup --fix` (not bare `setup`) carries
    the literal-credential warning; there is no CLI golden for `--secret` (run.sh replays readonly cases only).
  - P55-8: the check and the increment of a quota are not atomic (two concurrent sends in one pod could both pass at
    count-1); an unreadable counter counts as empty; `pod policies` and `check` do not show quotas.
  - A flake, once: `test_consult_wait.py::TestAnsweredInPlace::test_an_answer_by_the_task_goes_through_the_same_record`
    failed in the full run and passed alone (the file's other test is already on the list above).
  - Phase 56 Wave 2 merge run (2026-10-30), both passed alone: `test_consult_wait.py::TestAnsweredInPlace::
    test_a_decline_tells_the_model_to_decide_itself` (a third test of that class, so the class now has three flakes
    under load: that is its trigger), and `tests/integration/product/test_runtime_execution_envelope.py`, 8 setup
    errors from `uv build` exiting 2 in a parallel worker.
- *Declarative external services (became Phase 56, closed 2026-10-30).* The maintainer wants a pod to reach
  an external service from a `kind: service` document or commands (base URL, auth from the secret store, operations as
  read/send tools through `dispatch_tool`), with no program written per service and no more MCP implementation work. It
  reverses ADR 0036's "no native HTTP tool": written as decision 13 in the amendment of
  [ADR 0036](docs/adr/0036-a-pod-works-outward.md) (proposed 2026-10-30, not accepted; no new ADR). Sketch and open
  questions in `internal-docs/design/site-credentials-for-a-pod.md` (Addendum). Scope accepted 2026-10-30: Phase 56.
- *To investigate, important: a pod logging in to a site nobody configured.* Per-service MCP bridges and `secret:<name>`
  are fixed when a server is registered; a task that ends in a `send` at a new site that needs a login has no per-site
  credential the model never sees. Raised by the maintainer 2026-10-30. Analysis, seven open questions and a suggested
  path (ADR first, then `docket setup secret set`, then a per-site grant like the network grant, then a real run with a
  throwaway account) are in `internal-docs/design/site-credentials-for-a-pod.md`. No card yet.
- *Phase 59 merges and real runs (2026-11-03).* Seen while merging or in the six real runs.
  - The `bash` clamp is `max(1, int(deadline - now))`, so a hop clock of 2 s ends a clamped command at 1 s and
    the clock is not yet spent (`agent/loop_steps.py`). Round it up when a `time` stop is seen to need a
    second request.
  - Only an Implementer hop that ended `budget_exhausted` is pinned (ADR 0038 decision 2 reads wider). Trigger:
    a plan of record that needs the tree of another failed Implementer hop in the patch.
  - `--resume`'s lease still uses the pod's `turnTimeoutS` + `verifyTimeoutS` and ignores a step's `timeout`;
    the per-round claim refresh covers a live claim.
  - A `budget_exhausted` stop for a finalization reply that carried tool calls is a model misbehaviour with
    `stop_reason: token_budget`; it lands as a budget outcome. Trigger: one seen in a real trace.
  - A budget stop that entered its landing keeps the pre-landing reason: "cannot start tool-enabled task
    completion within token_budget=N ... no backend call made" (`agent/loop_budget.py`
    `prospective_budget_error`), though the landing call was made. It reads as a refusal with no call and
    quotes the 128000-token output reserve of a model with no registered cap. Trigger: an operator misreads
    one, or Tack shows the `reason` text.
  - The CLI cannot see why a task stopped: `docket task show` and `task list --json` print neither
    `failureKind` nor the hop's `budget`; they are in the HTTP task and `TASK_LIST.json`. Trigger: an
    operator asks for the limit that stopped a task from the terminal.
  - Tack's live run (2026-11-03) never reached a clean `time` stop: its request clock ran out first, as a
    transport timeout, while the loop was in its own landing. Unverified on docket's side (the landing's share of
    the clock, and whether a client's request timeout should exceed the step `timeout`). Trigger: a plan of record
    reports a `time` stop that arrived as a transport timeout, or a real run where the landing outlives its step
    clock.
  - A second implementation of a port can sit outside `src/` (the `docket-runtime` package's `Tracer`).
    Trigger: the next port-signature change sweeps `packages/` too (`rg` the method name there).
  - A policy `ask` on `.env.local.example` (a template, no secret) stopped the retried app-dev task. Trigger:
    the operator wants templates exempt from `block-destructive`.
- *Phase 59 planning (2026-11-02).* Left out of the phase by ADR 0038; each waits on its trigger.
  - docket continuing a budget-stopped hop on its own (ADR 0038 decision 6). Trigger: the same task
    retried after a `budget` stop with `treeChanged: true` three times in a week (audit `task.retry`
    plus the hop's `budget`).
  - A stall detector beyond identical calls (rounds that only re-read what the session already
    holds). Trigger: three Implementer `budget` stops with `treeChanged: false` in real runs.
  - The 300 s default hop clock (`AGENT_LOOP_WALL_CLOCK_TIMEOUT_S` after P59-4). Trigger: a `time` budget stop
    whose last `bash` the clamp killed (requirement 98's marker).
  - Parallel-group resume re-runs a group's ok children with their original prompt over their
    sessions (`pod-dispatch.spec.md` "Parallel step groups" item 6). Trigger: a group child re-run
    observed in a real retry.
- *Phase 58 planning (2026-11-01).* Asks from the manager audit that Tack would not read today.
  - `actor` on `POST /tasks/<pod>` and on retry. Enqueue audits no actor (`tasks/application/queue.py`
    ~237), and retry audits neither channel nor actor (`lifecycle.py` ~188). Tack sends `actor: "tack"`
    on resolve and nothing on enqueue. Trigger: Tack links an attempt to the principal that caused it
    and sends that principal.
  - `updatedAt` on a task, stamped beside `rev` in `tasks/application/json_store.py` ~40-49. Tack follows
    changes through `rev` and would show this only for work the board did not start. Trigger: a client
    that has to show when a task last moved.
  - A hop's `output` is not in the task shape of `operator-api.spec.md`. Tack uses `artifact.summary`
    as the reply of a conversation turn. Trigger: a recorded turn whose summary is too terse to serve
    as the reply.
  - Tack's audit found that `conversation.turns` (`len(hops)`, `tasks/domain/task.py` ~315) and
    `_park_turn`'s limit (`executor.py` ~338) would count a hop parked for approval as a turn. This is
    not verified by a run. It is the same trigger as "Turns taken" below.
- *Phase 58 wave 1 (2026-11-02).* Found by the workers of P58-1 to P58-3, none in a card.
  - An escalation's `seq` is issued before its record is written (`platform/store.py::write_escalation`).
    A poller reading between the two can return a later record and move `next` past the missing one.
    Trigger: a poller that reports a missed escalation, or a second writer that opens escalations
    concurrently with a poll.
  - Blocked outcomes other than the pod budget (`_block_on_missing_resources`, the `resources` block)
    carry no `failureKind`. Trigger: a client that has to tell those blocks apart.
  - `docket pod show --json` does not carry `paused`/`pausedReason` (`pod_report` feeds it;
    `cli-json-shapes.spec.md`). Trigger: an operator who reads the pause from the CLI JSON.
- *Phase 58 close (2026-11-02).* Seen once in the real run, not reproduced.
  - `POST /tasks/<pod>/<id>/cancel` sent a few milliseconds after `POST /tasks/<pod>` answered `409
    not_cancellable` ("is running; nothing to cancel"). The spec says a `running` task is cancelled by
    killing its hop's process group, so the claim had likely set `running` before any run or hop was there
    to stop. A client that cancels right after enqueueing gets a refusal for a task that then runs.
    Trigger: a second sighting, or Tack cancelling a task it just queued.
- *Phase 57 close (2026-11-01).* Loose ends of the phase, none a card yet; each waits on its trigger.
  - Park order. `_park_turn` marks the hop parked after it was persisted unparked and opens the `turn` escalation
    while the task is still `running` (`hops/application/executor.py`). A crash between leaves an unparked hop and a
    pending `turn`; replay moves past the step and the record expires unread. The reverse order would leave a
    waiting task nobody can answer, so this is the safer failure; a consult has the same window. Trigger: a
    conversation task found ended after a restart with a `turn` still pending.
  - One `current` slot. A parallel group names the child that started last and the key goes when that child ends
    (`operator-api.spec.md`). Trigger: Tack must show every running child; `current` then becomes a list under a
    new feature name.
  - "Turns taken" is read three ways: `len(hops)` in `_park_turn` and in the task dump, answered hops in the
    budget end. They agree until a final hop fails. Trigger: a `turns` count that disagrees with the hops shown.
  - Names written twice. The `reply` option id is in `answers.py` and in `escalations.py` (`_REPLY`); `tool_queue`
    and `tool_retry` in `mcp.py` repeat one queue dump; an error `code` reaches the wire as `DocketError.code` and
    as `_send_json_error(code=)`; `task_control.py` builds a `Conflict` only to render it. Trigger: the next edit of
    any of them.
  - `decide_task_tokens` is untouched: the budget end of a conversation is decided in the executor
    (`conversation_ends_on_budget`). Trigger: a second consumer of "ended after an answered turn".
  - `rev` shows in the CLI and MCP task dumps because they print the record; Tack reads it over HTTP only.
  - The live service on `:7399` runs the code from before the phase until it is restarted, and the `docket` on
    PATH until `./install.sh` runs again.
  - Flakes under load, each passing alone, seen once: `tests/guards/test_no_removed_cli_names.py` (a 2 s timing
    bound), `test_record_store_conformance.py` (two sqlite tests: the row cut, the CSV header) and
    `test_bash_background.py::TestTheTurnLeavesNoOrphan`. A second failure of the same test is its trigger.
- *Phase 56 close (the real run and the gates, 2026-10-30).*
  - Real evidence: `tests/live/test_hacker_news_live.py` (`DOCKET_RUN_LIVE_HN=1`) ran the `hacker-news` recipe against
    `hn.algolia.com` and the local model; the fourth run passed (see P56-22 in the archive). The write path of a declared
    service (park, approve, one `POST`) against a real model was **not** repeated at this close; the deterministic e2e
    (`tests/e2e/test_declared_service.py`, a scripted model) covers it. A run with the real model is the trigger for
    the first service that sends.
  - The role prompt's "end your reply with `## Memory`" line made a local model run `echo` through `bash`, and the
    gate parked the task for an approval nobody was there to give. The `hacker-news` steps say to run no command; the
    prompt in `builtin_roles.py` is unchanged (trigger: a second pod where a model does the same).
  - P56-10 left: a producer of git evidence for a non-implementer role. The `operate` and `routine` pods are workdir
    pods with no commits, so nothing would read it (trigger: a git-backed pod whose non-implementer step commits what
    a later step needs).
  - Tack's runner sends `"blueprint": "software"` in `POST /pods` and must send `build`.
  - `summarize_recipe` does not count a recipe's `services/`; `gen_recipe_docs._brings` and
    `pod_config_library._brings` are two near-duplicates. The `captured` column of `stories` holds the day a story
    was posted (the model has no clock); the row's `_at` is the capture time.
  - Prose still behind the code: the MCP client text ("workdir blueprint such as research"),
    `README.md` line 11 ("research, content or outward work"), `builtin_roles.py:68` ("forward-compat"), and
    `config-format.spec.md` (~line 115, `load_pipeline(text)`); `_blueprint_pipeline` loads a registry only to call
    `load_pipeline(None, ...)`; `conversations.load` returns an empty registry for an invalid file.
  - Records port (P56-23, merged): a second backend is one adapter module, one line in
    `bootstrap._open_records` and one `BACKENDS` entry in the conformance suite; a remote one needs the ADR
    amendment on `send` first, and S3 is an export destination, not a backend. `teams/records.py` quotes a set name
    in ANSI double quotes (each backend would quote its own); `ReadLimits` serves `read` and `export` though
    `export` honours only `timeout_s` (a possible `ExportLimits`).
  - Live Hacker News on Anthropic: the recipe ran on `claude-haiku-5-5` with Langfuse export (digest 218.9k tokens,
    weekly report 111.1k) and `tests/live` now takes `DOCKET_LIVE_HN_PROVIDER=anthropic`, but that lane was not run
    with a real key (setup only checked with a fake one). A fake key makes the run wait out its timeout instead of
    failing on the 401 at once.
  - Records and services: `pod update` does not check that a `rec__<set>` allow-list entry names a declared set;
    real PostgREST documents carry no `operationId`; `setup service list` shows secret names; the `ask-before-send` custom message is not shown
    for service sends; service results are not screened as untrusted; `pod records --csv` overwrites silently; the
    idempotency key also hashes path and query arguments; `pod-blueprints.spec.md` should list `services/`.
  - Code: `setup_model_credentials._write_credential` duplicates store logic; `config_docs.py` imports itself;
    `_read_until_deadline` is duplicated; `decided_approval` sits in `escalations.py`.
  - Flakes under load, each passes alone: the `test_consult_wait` decline test and the `uv build` in
    `test_runtime_execution_envelope`.
- *Phase 55 close (the repeated real run, 2026-10-30).* `docket run` does not wake a `wait` whose time has passed
  ("No pending tasks"); only the dispatch service's sweep does, as the spec says; a person expecting `run` to finish
  it is surprised (trigger: a second report). In one fresh home `setup provider add local ...` left the roles on
  `anthropic/*` until `setup model preset local` ran; an earlier fresh home applied the preset by itself: reproduce
  before a card. A stdio MCP server under isolation needs its script, interpreter and venv readable, and fails with
  `mcp_client.unavailable: ExceptionGroup` while python's "Permission denied" goes only to stderr (trigger: the next
  operator who meets it). P55-14 keys its note by task and role, not step, and splits the approval's `action` on
  `; call=` rather than reading a typed field; `task show --json` carries no `approval_unused`. P55-13 adds no trace
  line when the surface drops a role-named built-in (the closed event set has none that fits).
- *Live evidence, P55-5 (2026-10-30).* A real Playwright MCP server (0.0.83, headless system Chrome) driven through
  docket's MCP layer against a local page: under `lifetime: hop` navigate, snapshot and click by ref keep one session
  (the click ran, the page title changed); under `call` the snapshot after a navigate is `about:blank` and no ref
  exists. Not a model-driven pod run. That server's click argument is `target`, not `ref`.

**Phase 54 (closed 2026-10-29).** Two items wait for their triggers.
- *Dated model ids.* The native `/models` lists `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`, and the probe matches ids
  exactly, so `claude-haiku-4-5` never gets an observed output cap and a call without a declared
  `--max-tokens` fails by design. Trigger: a second operator who meets that refusal. Next: the probe
  matches a catalog id to the dated id that starts with it.
- *Names.* `openai_http.py` and `OpenAIChatClient` hold both wires and still carry the first one's name;
  ADR 0011, ADR 0014 and two specs quote them. Trigger: a third dialect or the next edit of either module.

**Outward work (ADR 0036, deferred with triggers; the cards are Phase 55).**

- **HTTP/SSE MCP transport** (`mcp-client.spec.md:50`). Trigger: the first real pod whose connector
  exists only hosted.
- **A per-pod `fetch` allowlist** (`kernel/home.py:278`, one list for the machine). Trigger: two pods
  on one machine that need different hosts.
- **`lifetime: task` for an MCP server.** Trigger: a recorded run in which a following hop needed the
  previous hop's session.
- **A structured-output gate** (a result that must match a schema). Trigger: a recorded run whose
  critic approved a malformed list.
- **Pod memory with non-path subjects** (`workspace-structure.spec.md:158-169`: a subject is a
  repository path; a workdir pod's "the client prefers a formal tone" has no home). Trigger: a recorded
  workdir run whose Lead repeats a correction a person already made.

**Standard teams and records (deferred from Phase 56, 2026-10-30; analysis in
`internal-docs/strategy/equipos-estandar-empresa-digital-2026-10-30.es.md` §8 and
`capa-de-datos-para-docket-2026-10-30.es.md`).**

- **A pod without a Lead member.** Not a blocker, so not a card: the Lead is the pod's *anchor record*
  (its workspace holds the queue, `teams/settings.py:21-26`, the settings and budget, `:29`,
  `teams/member_workspace.py:214`; `pre_input` is evaluated and session events traced as `"lead"`,
  `tasks/application/queue.py:72`, `governance/approval.py:73`), but no pipeline step has to use it: the
  `outward` recipe's pipeline already runs researcher, writer, critic, actor. Making the pod the subject is
  a persisted-state change (the queue's and settings' location). Trigger: a measured cost of the idle Lead
  member (its workspace, its row in `status`), or a pod whose operator refuses a Lead at all.
- **Measuring the three-role full pod against the four-role one** (P56-15 ships the change on the
  maintainer's request; this is the evidence it did not wait for). Trigger: a maintainer go, since the
  comparison spends hosted-model tokens on `app-dev`: the same tasks under both rosters, measured tokens
  and escaped defects.
- **A port for docket's task store** (`TaskRepository` takes the concrete `JsonTaskStore`,
  `tasks/application/repository.py:48`). Not business data, and a port with one implementation is the
  "unwired machinery" this project refuses. Trigger: a queue the one file cannot carry (measured).

**Fired, waiting for a maintainer go (the measurement spends hosted-model tokens).**

- **The implementer sends 0.65 of what the backend counts** (Phase 45 real runs on `app-dev`,
  2026-10-20: 14 and 13 calls, largest request about 7,000 estimated tokens; reviewer 0.62, tester 0.80
  and 0.90). The Phase 44 trigger ("a real implementer run with its grants declared that still sends
  over half") fired. Next: P52-1 measures which calls repeat on the recorded traces (no live run
  needed); P53-4 (which absorbed P52-5) acts on the figure.

**Model adaptation and context (ADR 0033, deferred with triggers; the cards are Phase 52).**

- **Reasoning kept inside the turn** (`ChatMessage.reasoning`, resent only in the active tool
  loop; `reasoning_content` is dropped today in `models/adapters/openai_wire.py::decode_response`).
  Trigger: a profile that declares `reasoning: interleaved`.
- **Lifecycle condensation** (a `read` superseded by a later `read` or an `edit` of the same file
  is evicted first, in batches aligned to steps). Trigger: after P52-2 (which absorbed P52-8), the bench `--repeats`
  still shows re-reads on the recorded implementer steps.
- **A bounded model escalation** on a step (`escalate: {on: [verify_failed, no_progress], model:
  strong, max: 1}`), audited. Trigger: the `strong-plan-cheap-edit` recipe (P52-6) fails
  `verifyCmd` on a measured share of real runs.
- **A lazy MCP catalog** (`mcp_describe(server, tool)`, the tool list kept stable within a turn).
  Trigger: a pod whose MCP schemas exceed its built-in ones (`request_part_bytes["tools"]`).
- **A native Anthropic dialect** (1 h TTL, `cache_control` on tools, signed thinking blocks; the
  provider note already defers it). Trigger: direct use without the gateway, which caches today.

**Escalations (left at the Phase 51 close, 2026-10-25; ADR 0032).**

- **Approval, gate and `check_changed` follow-ups still run inside `resolve`** (`approval_grant`
  and the task-grant audit in `tasks/application/escalations.py`), not on the claim path; P51-6
  stopped at PARTIAL because deferring them breaks `approved_ready`, which reads pregrants and
  `gateOverridePipelineIndex`, and P51-9's "Also" list named the move. Trigger: a change to
  `approved_ready` or to the claim path.
- **Settled escalations written before P51-11 stay in the flat `escalations/` directory**; no
  migration is written. A scan of the live directory still opens them (`platform/store.py::list_escalations`
  reads the flat folder for `pending` and unfiltered scans). Trigger: an operator whose pre-P51-11
  records slow the inbox; then move them under `settled/` once.
- **`GET /escalations?since=` reads every settled file** (`operator/inbox.py::escalation_views`
  calls `list_escalations(since_seq=...)` with no state, so `settled/` is scanned on each poll).
  Trigger: a poller whose `settled/` directory is large; then index by `seq` or bound the scan.
- **docket follows an enclosing git repository when a pod path is not itself one**
  (`platform/git.py::git_is_repo` answers `rev-parse --git-dir`, true anywhere inside a work tree),
  so it would prepare and branch the enclosing repository. Only the live-eval and smoke worlds
  refuse that today (`specs/test-framework.md`). Trigger: a pod registered on a subdirectory or
  a nested path that is not a repo.
- **`scripts/render-doc-assets.py:275` prints a made-up approval token** (`token=apr-...`) and the
  `waiting_approval` line, shapes Phase 51 removed. Trigger: the maintainer re-captures the README
  assets (a classifier-refused step); then render the escalation id and `waiting_input`.

**Test suite under load (found at the Phase 47 close, 2026-10-24; each passes alone).**

- **Timing flakes seen once each:**
  `test_retries_and_timeouts.py::TestRetryDoesNotTripStaleClaimSweep`, and the foreground approval
  deny test (its fake approval timeout was raised from 5 s to 60 s, `1a704359`). Trigger: a second
  failure of the same test. Then replace its wall-clock wait with an event.
- **Docstring budget:** `comment_lint.py` counts 209 long definition docstrings at the close against 205
  on `develop` (most moved or renamed code). Trigger: the next card that edits one of those modules
  trims its own.
- **Two contract files set the merge run's floor** (measured 2026-10-28, `--durations=0`):
  `tests/contracts/test_a2a_http.py` 60 s and `test_escalation_http.py` 35 s of the 84 s run. Each
  test's function-scoped `parked` fixture runs a real `docket run` and starts a service (about 3 s
  of setup per test), and `--dist loadfile` keeps a file on one worker. Trigger: the merge run
  passes 120 s, or a card adds a test to either file. Then share one parked world per module for
  the read-only tests.

**Runtime and dispatch (from real runs).**

- **A refused task is resumed on every 30 s sweep tick** (`dispatch_refused` is in
  `RESUMABLE_FAILURE_KINDS`, `tasks/domain/state.py`; operator-api §6 by design). Trigger: the audit log
  fills with one task's refusals, or a second operator asks. Then resume only when the cause changed.
- **A parked turn is paid twice**: the resumed hop re-sends the whole prompt (4,157 input tokens before
  the park, 8,181 after; 100,573 in the 2026-10-18 joint run). Trigger: a third run that parks on the
  same shape. Then weigh resuming the session over re-running the hop (operator-loop §2 item 6).
- **A hop refused before any call records an empty model** (`hop_finished.model == ""`, a `""` key in
  `usage.byModel`). Trigger: a reader of `byModel` that trips on it.
- **Provider rows lag the models in use:** Anthropic advertises dated ids while the template rows use
  aliases (limits stay `unknown`), and no row prices `claude-sonnet-5-5` or `claude-opus-5-5`
  (`task show` prints `cost: -`). Trigger: a run on an alias id whose window matters, or an operator
  asking for the estimate.
- **Hop language drift:** a resumed step once wrote its report in another language, which became the
  next handoff. Trigger: a second occurrence; then a pod `language` setting.
- **The Lead plans with the codebase path while the Implementer is rooted in the task worktree**
  (`tool.refused` on `read`). Trigger: reproduce with a local-model dispatch in a worktree pod.
- **The prospective budget check ignores cache reads**, so a heavily cached step is refused early.
  Trigger: a real run refused with room left. `glob`/`grep` walk vendored trees before filtering;
  measure before changing.
- **A task's `network: none` cuts the agent turn only**; `verifyCmd` and `run:` steps keep the pod's
  posture (stated in the spec).
- **Cancel over HTTP reports `cancelled` once the stop is requested**; the task stays `running` until
  the executor notices. The slow-stub cancel path has no test.
- **Not examined:** each Phase 45 run's trace carries two `approval_denied` events beside its park.
- **Real-Docker tests exceed their duration ceiling under load** (`test_network_lockdown`,
  `test_sandboxed_exec`, the escape matrix's docker cases): they pass alone. A flake, measured
  2026-10-14.

**Workspace and checks.**

- **`docket setup` without `--fix` writes:** its report re-seeds `WORKFLOW_AUTO.md`
  (`interfaces/cli/commands/setup_check.py`). A check that writes is a defect. Trigger: the next edit
  of that file.
- **A file a check reaches only through `make` or `npm run` is protected only through the default
  files it reads**, and **a gitignored file is invisible to the check**. Trigger: a real gate whose
  script lives behind a target, or a repository that ignores a file its gate reads.
- **Prepare:** only `node_modules` is cached (`.venv` is not relocatable); `node_modules/.cache` is
  read-only in the jail; eviction can break a running task's link (resume prepares again); prepare is
  not cancellable (bounded by `PREPARE_TIMEOUT_S`); `hops/workspace/prepare.py::linked_entries` accepts
  any cache entry, not only the task's codebase. Trigger: a real run that hits one of them.
- **Shell keywords are classified as binaries when unjailed** (`for`, `do`, `done`, `if`, `then`,
  `while` ask in `governance/security`). Trigger: an operator without isolation reports it.

**Configuration.**

- **A tool deny per team member** (a read-only researcher): `tool_profile` is prose, the only denial is
  the pod-wide `deniedTools`. Trigger: a recipe or pod that needs one member without write tools.
- **Delete the old-layout reader** (`kernel/layout.py::is_legacy` and the legacy branches of `Home`).
  Trigger: the next minor release. First move what still seeds or reads an old-layout home:
  `tests/support/home.py` and `pods.py`, and the old paths named in `scripts/gen_cli_docs.py`,
  `scripts/render-doc-assets.py` and `docs/commands.md`.
- **Parallel tasks in a pod:** ADR 0027 point 10 holds the trigger; a card would add a
  `maxParallelTasks` pod setting and a bounded pool in dispatch.
- **A team's skills:** `hops/workspace/skills.py` reads only `<codebase>/.docket/skills`; a repository
  keeping `teams/<pod>/` has no per-team skills scope.

**Channels, inbox and the HTTP API.**

- **`docket start`'s periodic notify flush ignores `FlushReport.error`** (`interfaces/http/server.py:200`).
- **Enabling the `email` channel checks nothing**; with no `to`, `from` or `smtpHost`, every delivery
  fails into the health record. Trigger: an operator enables it.
- **Pending memory entries show in `docket inbox` but not in `GET /inbox`, MCP `inbox`, notifications or
  Telegram `/status`.** Needs an operator-v1 inbox contract bump.
- **`GET /pods` (the list) was not checked** for the invalid-settings failure fixed on `/pods/<p>`.
- **`POST /pods/<p>/apply` with every item skipped writes no `pod.apply` audit entry.**
- **The corrections cursor needs `+` percent-encoded in `since`**; a pod whose Lead was removed but
  whose ledger remains answers `404`.
- **The `openhands` and `pydantic_ai` adapters never pass `cache_write_tokens`**
  (`packages/docket-runtime/src/docket_runtime/adapters/`). Trigger: someone reads that usage.

**Prompts and pod state.**

- `hops/application/compose.py::_resolve_hop_instructions` still opens "You are the Implementer..."
  (SOUL says it); recipe roles using `${codebaseOrConfigured}` render a path; `repo_map.SKIPPED_DIRS`
  mirrors `toolbox.SKIPPED_DIRS` (pinned by an equality test); pod read routes do not carry
  `tokenBudget`; the condensation notice carries the call's full path.
- **Every member of a pod shares the base session key `agent:<pod>:<key>`** (`teams/pod.py`); no turn
  reads it today. Trigger: a turn that does.
- **Three readers of the implementer's codebase** (`rg -n "def _pod_codebase|def _codebase|def
  task_diff" src`); one helper when next touched.
- **`memory_update` has no structural telemetry key**; members stamped `POD_TEMPLATE_VERSION` 4 show stale
  to `pod update` by text comparison; `scripts/smoke_workflow.py`'s memory scenario needs a live run.

**Phases 52 and 53 (closed 2026-10-29).** Triaged the same day: the brief redaction, the prompt `tests` file, a role's
unknown tool name, `pod test`'s handoff spec, the live-run key lookup and the stale docs were fixed; what stays waits
for its trigger.

- **P52-12, a wait on a machine is an escalation.** Absorbed by P55-6 (ADR 0036 decision 5): a `wait` step is
  an escalation of kind `wait` the sweep settles on time or on a probe; the wait on a machine is one case of it.
- **P53-4 goal 3, the Lead's locators read into the Implementer's message.** Measured on three recorded smoke tasks
  (two local Qwen, one Haiku, `context_replay.py --repeats`): the Implementer read 1/1, 1/1 and 2/4 files the Lead had
  read, but all except one were files it then edited, whose exact text `edit` needs; "not edited after" was 0, 0 and
  1 file (682 bytes). Trigger: "not edited after" reaching 30 % of the Implementer's reads on recorded tasks of a real
  pod (the smoke repository has three files).
- **The model class comes only from the rank anchors** (`economy` is `cheap`, `standard` and `premium` are `strong`),
  so a non-anchor model such as the local Qwen resolves `any` and no `<name>.<class>.md` variant acts for it. No
  shipped prompt has a variant. Trigger: a variant written for a non-anchor model.
- **Structured `task` intake** exists on `POST /tasks/<pod>` only; the CLI, MCP and Tack's runner do not send it.
  Trigger: Tack adopting it.
- **Decided, not open:** P52-2's bench oracle is "no step worse than the recorded request, and prefix stability not
  worse", met on the fixture (sent 0.25 to 0.66 of the baseline per step; stable 8/10, 3/4, 5/7, 6/7). The "+0.3 %
  to +3 %" was against the pre-P52-2 `condense_history`, which the bench's `phase44` policy now calls live, so it is no
  longer reproducible; the small-result rule stays. The re-ask, finalization and closing texts
  (`hops/application/runner.py`, `agent/loop_request.py`) are the harness's protocol, versioned with the code and the
  agent-loop spec, not role prompts. `smoke_workflow.py` calls an interpreter running a script (`PYTHONPATH=src python3
  x.py`) opaque on purpose: it can read any file, so the private-path check fails closed; `VAR=x` alone is parsed.

**Architecture and packaging.**

- **The runtime closure grows with any facade on a context the runtime imports** (measured in P47-8:
  agent 52 -> 75, teams 52 -> 157, governance 52 -> 101, observability 52 -> 60 files). Trigger: a
  proposed facade on one of them.
- **`FailureKind` enumerates only the four kinds the task state writes**; hop and gate kinds stay plain
  strings (pod-dispatch spec item 9). Trigger: the next change to those kinds.

**Tests.**

- A worker's `monkeypatch.undo()` once undid the autouse home isolation and wrote into the real
  `~/.docket`; the fixture guards `setattr`, not `undo`. Trigger: a second leak.
