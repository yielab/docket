# TODO — active task board

> **This is docket's single standing TODO file.** It holds the executable cards for whatever phase is

> **Wave 71 (P35-1..P35-4) is DONE, merged to `develop`** (`9dd0a7f`, `7b42f86`, `e7dc098`,
> `44e35e4`; harness-mode.spec.md's P35-3 stub reconciled in `72cebea`; spec version bumps in

>
> **Phase 34 closed 2026-09-29** (ROADMAP D-50,
> [ADR 0016](docs/adr/0016-operator-loop-and-interop-standards.md)): seventeen cards over Waves
> 64–70, one worker per card (Sonnet, or Haiku where the card said so) in isolated worktrees
> under one integrator; the section is archived verbatim in
> [docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md](docs/cycles-ended/todo-waves.md) and packets stay in
> [.agents/handoffs/wave-64-worker-packets.md](.agents/handoffs/wave-64-worker-packets.md).
> What shipped: an unattended pod **parks** instead of blocking (`approvalMode: park`, a
> single-use pre-grant on the re-entered hop); the Lead's typed `TaskBrief` intake asks before it
> builds, with a deterministic resource pre-check and the `intake` recipe; one derived inbox
> (`docket inbox`, `GET /inbox`, the MCP `inbox` tool, Telegram `/status`); notifications as
> CloudEvents over every v1 `kind: channel` dialect (console, webhook, command, ntfy, desktop,
> email, Telegram); questions in the MCP elicitation shape and every task state mapped onto A2A
> 1.0.0; answer surfaces on CLI, `docket chat`, HTTP, MCP and Telegram's new `/answer` verb;
> interruption forecasting (`docket pod <p> explain interruptions`) and pre-grants from intake.
> The integrator's close (P34-17) added three real seam tests (HTTP-driven park→pregrant→
> redispatch, channel content-level enforcement at actual delivery, and the operator's answer
> text reaching the Lead's own re-entry message) and found two real defects by running the
> product rather than reading it: the operator-loop scenario's own `eventsDelivered` counter read
> a health-file key that never existed (always `0`); `--live-model` registered its provider after
> `docket init`, so that path had never actually completed `init`. A third, unrelated regression
> the starter's own persisted-shape check caught: `HandoffArtifact` gained a `brief` field with no
> update to the starter's asserted shape or its own spec. Both deferred triggers this phase left
> behind were evaluated at the close and did not fire (recorded in the ADR, not acted on): fewer
> than 10 real parked approvals exist to measure the pre-grant re-issue rate against, and the
> scripted-backend scenario shows `park` removing the blocking wait it targets — a live model's
> own serial per-hop generation latency is a separate, real cost worth a maintainer's attention,
> not this trigger's condition. `docket inbox`/`channels`/`notify`/`pregrant`/`explain
> interruptions` still lack coverage in `cli-interface.spec.md`, flagged there for a follow-up
> card rather than backfilled under this pass's time budget. Nothing else is parked.
>
> **Phase 33 closed 2026-09-28** (ROADMAP D-49, [ADR 0015](docs/adr/0015-export-privacy-levels.md)):

> What shipped: an exporter document declares what it shares beyond structure (`privacy:
> minimal|actions|conversation|full` or `share:`; `minimal` for every built-in; `payload`
> retired and loaded as `minimal`); an allowlist projection maps each attribute to one class and
> filters conversations per message part; `llm_call` and `tool_result` capture content only
> while an exporter grants it; `docket exporters privacy` widens only after naming what leaves
> and to which host (TTY confirmation or `--yes`, audited); `docket exporters preview` shows the
> exact spans offline; `SHARES`, "Leaves this host", `docket.privacy` on every root span.
> Verified live at three levels with canaries against a local collector and Langfuse, none at
> `minimal`. Lessons: the seam test between two green cards found a real gap twice (the
> per-exporter bound skipped `response`/`arguments`; the live loop never wrote tool output) —
> the second only showed on a real run, because every earlier test fed synthetic records that
> already had the field. Follow-up recorded, not scheduled: the idle flush can emit a session's
> root span twice (`observability-export.spec.md` §"Privacy levels").

> [.agents/handoffs/wave-56-worker-packets.md](.agents/handoffs/wave-56-worker-packets.md).
> What shipped: every backend chat-completions exchange is a durable `llm_call` trace event;
> `core/telemetry.py` deterministically projects the trace into a neutral `Span`/`SpanEvent`
> model with `metadata`/`full` payload reduction; a destination is a `kind: exporter` YAML
> document (five ready-made, disabled-by-default: `otel-collector`, `jaeger`, `langfuse`,
> `honeycomb`, `phoenix`) speaking one hand-rolled `otlp-http` wire dialect, no SDK dependency
> (D-24 stands); a bounded queue/background-sender `Pipeline` is wired into every turn;
> `docket exporters list|show|enable|disable|test|add|remove|export` turns a destination on by
> authenticating; a pod names its destinations in `pod.yaml`'s `exporters:`, reported, never
> itself activating. Verified live 2026-09-28 against a real dispatch and a real
> `otel/opentelemetry-collector`; the live Langfuse round-trip was confirmed the
> same day once the operator stored `LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY`/`LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY`. Two
> recurring integration lessons: independent cards that version-bump the same still-Draft spec
> from the same base conflict on merge, predictably (happened three times, reconciled by hand
> each time); a card's own literal acceptance text can be stale relative to already-shipped code
> from an earlier card in the same phase (P32-8, P32-9) — implement against the verified live
> behavior and record the discrepancy, per AGENTS.md's rule, rather than choosing the convenient

## How to use this board (read before claiming a task)

1. **Claim:** set Status → `IN-PROGRESS (@you)`. One agent per task.
2. **Read first (bounded):** use `$docket-roadmap` to load the active card, its named ROADMAP
   decision/section, the owning spec, and the card's own "Read" list. Do not ingest all of
   `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md`, or local `CLAUDE.md` as startup context.
3. **Layer rule (non-negotiable):** `cli/ → core/ → edges/`, inward only. docket-owned JSON goes
   **only** through `edges/store.py` (JSONL append logs are the one D-12 exemption), external
   protocols terminate in `edges/adapters/`, and there is no compatibility layer for the retired
   daemon. Every shell-out goes through `edges/adapters/`. `core/`/`edges/` never import `ui.py` or
   print (D-3 from Phase 12).
4. **No-behavior-change rule, except where a card says otherwise:** the golden suite
   (`bash tests/golden/run.sh verify-all`) must stay byte-identical unless a card explicitly adds new
   CLI surface — those cards say so and require regenerated goldens with the diff explained.
   **Regenerating a golden to paper over an unintended behaviour change is never acceptable**; W-6 in
   particular must prove the four legacy roles still emit byte-identical workspaces.
5. **Definition of done (per task):** acceptance criteria pass · a pytest covers it (add/refresh a
   golden case if output changes) · `uv run ruff check . && uv run ruff format --check . && uv run
   mypy src && uv run pytest` green · `bash tests/golden/run.sh verify-all` green ·
   `bash scripts/validate-specs.sh` green · `uv run python scripts/gen_cli_docs.py --check` green
   (regenerate `docs/commands.md` whenever a Typer docstring or help text changes) · `uv run pytest
   tests/agent` green when prose or an artifact moved · the integrator re-measures
   `scripts/metrics.py --check` per batch (card branches that add tests fail it by design) · the
   card's own spec updated with a version bump + changelog entry (integrator-applied in a
   multi-agent wave), **Status line matching what actually shipped** · committed `Type: description`
   (no Claude/Co-Authored-By trailer) · public-repo privacy scrubbed (grep the diff for real names /
   `/home/<user>` paths before committing).
6. **Central files:** `ROADMAP.md`, `TODO.md` and `README.md`'s metric counts are maintained by the
   integrator, **not** by card branches. Phase 14 lost time to roll-up checkboxes and README test
   counts conflicting on nearly every merge; cards now report what they shipped instead of editing
   the board.

**Status legend:** `TODO` · `IN-PROGRESS (@who)` · `BLOCKED (needs X)` · `DONE`
**Size:** S ≈ ½ day · M ≈ 1–2 days · L ≈ 3–5 days (split before claiming if L)
**Branch model (D-52, amending D-31):** **`develop`** is the integration branch. Every card
branch or isolated worktree bases on `develop` and is integrated into `develop` without
rewriting history. **`main`** stays the canonical public/default and release lineage: it moves
only by a fast-forward (or a merge) from `develop`, when the maintainer cuts a release or
decides `main` has fallen too far behind. Tags and release jobs still originate from `main`.
`platform` may remain as a synchronized historical ref, but it is not a release source.

## ◇ NO ACTIVE WAVE — Phase 35 closed 2026-10-04 (archived above in docs/cycles-ended/)

Phase 36 is not open. The next cards are written when the integrator opens it, from the outline below.

## ◇ PLANNED — Phases 36–38 (D-51 follow-on; not claimable)

These are outlines, not cards. The integrator writes each phase's cards when it opens and
re-verifies every locator against the tree at that moment, because a gap list decays. Each
phase opens only after the previous one closes. The phase that reverses an earlier ADR records
that in its own ADR (ADR 0017 "What this reverses" lists them as not decided yet).

**Phase 36 — consultation and evidence packs (CRP v1, evidence-v1).** Opens after Phase 35.
- **operator-v1.1 contract.** `Question.kind` (`approval|clarification|decision`); `options[]`
  (`id`, `label`, `description`, `risks`, `estimatedTokens`); `recommendation` (`optionId`,
  `rationale`, `evidenceRefs[]`); `Answer.optionId`. Approval grant and deny gain `reason` and
  `actor` (closes the ADR 0016 §8 drift). JSON Schema under `docs/contracts/operator-v1.1/`.
- **A `consult` built-in tool for every role** (not only the Lead under `intake`). It requires
  options and a recommendation. Outcome by posture: `park` → `waiting_input`; harness
  `--answers stdin` → stdio; `refuse` → `blocked` with the pack in the result. Capped by
  `maxConsultationsPerTask` (the attention budget).
- **Approval packs.** A gated call carries the model's stated rationale (screened, truncated)
  and three options: approve once, approve for this task (a pre-grant), deny with reason.
- **A corrections ledger.** Deny reasons, `REQUEST-CHANGES` texts and declined answers go
  append-only to a per-pod `corrections.jsonl` (D-12 exemption shape); `docket pod <p>
  corrections`. This is the input for an external verifier's directive proposals.
- **evidence-v1.** A published schema of what P35-4 persists, plus per-hop measured tokens and
  trace ids. `docket pod <p> evidence <task> [--json]`; `GET /tasks/<p>/<id>/evidence`; the same
  block in harness v1.1 results.
- **Escalation metrics.** `docket_tasks_started_total`; `docket_questions_total{kind,outcome}`;
  `docket_decision_latency_seconds` from inbox transitions; `docket metrics --escalation`. Kept
  in measured tokens and seconds, never dollars.

**Phase 37 — verification-ready execution.** Opens after Phase 36.
- `pre_input` screening of **MCP tool results** (today only descriptions are screened).
- A worktree per task instead of per member.
- **Recipes, no core change:**
  - `mutation`: a `run:` step with a threshold, scoped to changed lines;
  - `cross-family-review`: a reviewer with a `model:` from another provider family;
  - `spec-writer`: tests derived from the brief by a different model, before the Implementer;
  - `anti-tautology`: new tests must fail on `baseCommit`.
- A `no_progress` stop reason in the loop: no new passing check or an oscillating diff over N
  iterations.
- An AEE MCP pack as recipes (ast-grep, an LSP server, a semantic index), declared `kind: read`
  where true.

**Phase 38 — the L4 execution envelope.** Opens after Phase 37.
- Isolation on by default, with a preflight. File tools and MCP servers jailed, not only `bash`.
- An egress lockdown mode (`--network none` plus the `fetch` allowlist). This reverses ADR 0004's
  default for autonomy-granted domains.
- Per-pod sweep workers (parallel dispatch across pods).
- Ephemeral per-task credentials.
- A `kind: autonomy` document consumed from the external verifier: domain → required recipe,
  models, checks and authority. docket enforces it; it never computes it (ADR 0017 §5).
